#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)Since the first and last lines are constants O(1) and the while loop is linear O(n) then we drop constants and the total is O(n)
O(1) + O(n2) + O(1) = O(n)

a = 0 # constant T O(1)
while (a < n _ n _ n): # linear T O(n)
a = a + n \* n # constant T O(1)

```


b)


c)
